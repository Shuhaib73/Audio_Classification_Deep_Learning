*Description*

* *The objective of this application is to perform audio classification to swiftly analyse audio files (.wav format) and provide a rapid classification of the sound into its respective class. The application utilizes the power of ANNâ€™s i.e. Artificial Neural Networks to reliably predict the sound class with remarkable accuracy and precision.*
* *The dataset comprises 8732 labeled sound excerpts (4s each) from ten urban sound categories. These include air for audio prediction, car horns, children playing, dog barking, drilling, engine idling, gunshots, jackhammers, sirens, and street music. Before model development, we perform basic data preprocessing and feature extraction on audio signals. Each model is then evaluated based on accuracy, training time, and prediction time. Model deployment allows users to load a desired sound output for successful deployment, discussed in detail.*
*For each species, the dataset classifies them as either edible or poisonous, or of unkown edibility and not recommended. notably, the latter category has been merged with the poisonous one.*
* *Our objective is to develop a machine learning classification model capable of predicting whether a given mushroom is poisonous or edible based on provided features.*
